    Two-layer fanout template with 5 nodes in Stage 1.
    Stage 2 keeps Q5-pack (20B), Q1-pack (32B), narrative (20B), and final merger.
    Removed Stage 2 14B node (Q3-pack).
    Added HTTP fanout for Q0a/Q0b (5x 0.1s, 3x 0.1s) and replaced SQL with 2.0s HTTP sleeps.
    HTTP call counts (former DB queries):
      - Stage 1: 4 / 2 / 1 (+ Q0a/Q0b fanout)
      - Stage 2: 4 / 1 (+ final merger)
    All HTTP calls depend on user_query and tpch_params.
