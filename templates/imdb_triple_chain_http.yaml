  description: >
    Triple-chain IMDb workflow with a keyword planner root.
    10 LLM nodes in total (excluding user_input). Each chain has exactly
    one DB query (movies/people/crew), and all queries depend only on
    search_keyword. The final head no longer issues DB queries.
    Uses exactly three models: Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-14B, and openai/gpt-oss-20b.
    Model types are arranged so that different epoch groupings can either
    reuse the same model or incur extra switches depending on ordering.
    HTTP stand-ins replace the DB queries for chain entry retrieval.

  nodes:
    - id: user_input
      type: input
      outputs:
        - user_query
